# 🌱 Sustain-A-Prompt

*Because every keystroke has a footprint.*  
An eco-aware **prompt optimizer** built at **PennApps XXVI** with **Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind v4, and shadcn/ui**.  

👉 Enter a prompt → we estimate **energy ⚡ / CO₂ 🌍 / water 💧** impact → we generate an optimized prompt with projected savings → and render a clean, copy-paste-ready answer (thanks to our regex-powered sanitizer).

## ✨ Why it’s cool
- **Optimized Prompting:** Get a leaner, greener prompt with % savings shown right up front.  
- **Eco Stats You Can Flex:** Glowing metric cards display your energy, CO₂, and water footprint.  
- **No AI Clutter:** Regex sanitizer scrubs disclaimers, fences, and markdown noise.  
- **Cyberpunk Vibes:** Dark glassmorphism, neon accents (aqua/green/violet), and smooth animations.  
- **Modern Architecture:** Next.js App Router split (server + client), safe for RSC.  
- **Auth-Ready:** Login/Register routes, toast feedback, and header actions built-in.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router, RSC), TypeScript  
- **UI:** Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, lucide-react, Sonner toasts  
- **Animations:** framer-motion, @motionone/react  
- **APIs:** Google Gemini (prompt optimization), Cerebras (chat/models)  

⚠️ *Note:* **styled-jsx** will break builds in Next 15. Stick with Tailwind.

## 🔄 How It Works
1. You drop in a prompt (chat-style console).  
2. Backend estimates its **energy, CO₂, and water** footprint.  
3. UI glows with eco stats + suggests a greener prompt.  
4. Response is sanitized → clean, readable answer box.
